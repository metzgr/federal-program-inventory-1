objective: 'Nurses understand that improving health and well-being means addressing
  people’s needs in multiple settings, contexts, and over the life course. NINR-supported
  science uses nursing’s holistic patient and community-focused perspective and wide
  reach across clinical and community settings to improve individual and population
  health by addressing the conditions where people live, learn, work, and play: those
  factors that are at the root of the health challenges that we see. NINR has a longstanding
  and continued commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists:
  those individuals and teams who will carry nursing research into the future.'
