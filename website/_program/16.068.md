objective: 'The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) is the
  component of the U.S. Department of Justice responsible for advancing the practice
  of community policing by the Nation’s state, local, territorial, and tribal law
  enforcement agencies through information and grant resources. Since inception, the
  COPS Office has been appropriated more than $20 billion to advance community policing,
  including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local, territorial, and tribal
  law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring and redeployment of more than 136,000
  officers. COPS Office information resources, covering a wide range of community
  policing topics such as school and campus safety, violent crime, and officer safety
  and wellness, can be downloaded via the COPS Office’s home page, https://cops.usdoj.gov.



  The COPS Hiring Program (CHP) provides funding to law enforcement agencies to hire
  and/or rehire additional career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase
  their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. Anticipated outcomes
  of CHP awards include engagement in planned community partnerships, implementation
  of projects to analyze and assess problems, implementation of changes to personnel
  and agency management in support of community policing, and increased capacity of
  agency to engage in community policing activities necessary to prevent crime.


  Community policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that
  support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively
  address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as
  violent crime, nonviolent crime, and fear of crime. To read an overview of the principles
  of community policing, please see the COPS Office publication, "Community Policing
  Defined".'
