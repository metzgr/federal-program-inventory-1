objective: The People’s Garden community connects gardens across the country that
  produce local food, practice sustainability, create jobs, and strengthen communities.
  People’s Gardens empower communities to grow healthy nutritious food in a sustainable
  way and teach about the benefits of local, resilient food systems. These gardens
  foster community collaboration, create jobs and train future farmers,  prioritize
  green spaces, provide access to nutritious food, and benefit the environment. People’s
  Gardens are different sizes and types, and can include school gardens, community
  gardens, urban farms, innovative, indoor and controlled environment operations,
  and small-scale agriculture projects in rural and urban areas. They cannot be personal
  gardens located at private residences.
