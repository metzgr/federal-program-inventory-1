objective: 'The mission of the Commission is to provide grant funding and programs
  to economically distressed and persistent poverty communities to carry out infrastructure
  improvements and economic development across the Southwest region, which encompasses
  some of the highest poverty rates in the United States. The federal-state partnership
  comprises the Federal Co-Chair and the four Governors of the participating States
  of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. From participating states, one Governor
  is selected as the State Co-Chair. The State Alternates’ offices are the coordinators
  for the Governors for SBRC investments. All activities funded by the SBRC must advance
  the Commission’s Five-Year Strategic Plan. The responsibility for the development
  of plans and programs authorized under the enabling statute is vested in the Commission.
  The Commission establishes general policies and procedures and the allocation of
  funds among the programs and states. SBRC activities and projects must align with
  one or more of the five strategic goals identified in the SBRC five-year strategic
  plan: (1) Addressing Barriers to Growth and Opportunity, (2) Amplify Regional Comparative
  Advantage, (3) Generate Workforce Development and Economic Mobility, (4) Build Economically
  Resilient and Self-Sustaining Communities, (5) Maximize Investment Efficiency and
  Impact.

  Additional information regarding these goals and associated objectives can be found
  at sbrc.gov.'
