objective: The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) is intended to expand limited federal
  capacity to implement and plan forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration projects
  by facilitating partnerships with authorized states, counties, and federally recognized
  Indian tribes. The GNA authority specifically allows the National Park Service (NPS)
  to enhance state-federal relationships and address cross-boundary land restoration
  needs. This includes activities such as treating insect-and-disease-infested trees;
  reducing hazardous fuels; and any other activities to restore or improve forest,
  rangeland, and watershed health, including fish and wildlife habitat. This type
  of work reduces wildfire risk to habitat, communities, and state trust lands; creates
  greater forest and watershed resilience against drought, insects, disease, and wildfire;
  and expands much-needed work across state and federal lands.
