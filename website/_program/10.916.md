objective: To provide technical and financial assistance to rehabilitate dams originally
  constructed with assistance of USDA Watershed Programs. Rehabilitation must extend
  the life of the dam and meet applicable safety and performance standards. Priority
  is given to dams that maximize risk reduction and that could result in loss of life
  if the dam should fail.

results:
- description: Five dams were rehabilitated, four designs were completed, and 24 plans
    were authorized by the Chief of NRCS for rehabilitation, the most ever in a single
    year since 2000. Additionally, 73 assessments of high hazard dams were funded.
    These assessments provided communities with technical information about the condition
    of their dams, and alternatives for rehabilitation of dams that do not currently
    meet Federal dam safety standards.
