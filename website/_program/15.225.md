objective: Public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provide some
  of the most diverse outdoor recreation opportunities on Federal lands in the western
  United States. The BLM’s Recreation and Visitor Services Program oversees a broad
  and complex set of recreation related programs, which provide a multitude of recreation
  opportunities and experiences. These recreation resources and visitor services support
  strong local economies and public land conservation. As BLM works to enhance recreational
  opportunities, we strive to remain a good neighbor and partner. The BLM manages
  recreation resources and visitor services to offer the greatest benefits possible
  to individuals and communities and to better enable communities to achieve their
  own desired social, economic, and environmental outcomes. BLM public lands are now
  recognized as America’s Great Outdoors, a “Backyard to Backcountry” treasure. They
  are uniquely accessible. More than 120 urban centers and thousands of rural towns
  are located within 25 miles of BLM lands. The Recreation and Visitor Services Program
  provides a wide variety of recreational opportunities that benefit the public and
  local communities. The program is also responsible for implementing Administration
  and Department priorities.
