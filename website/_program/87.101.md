objective: The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) partners with
  the private sector to advances U.S. foreign policy and strengthen national security
  by mobilizing private capital around the world. DFC invests across strategic sectors
  including critical minerals, modern infrastructure, and advanced technology — fostering
  private-sector led economic development, supporting U.S. interests, and delivering
  returns to American taxpayers. DFC provides loans and loan guarantee financing,
  equity, and political risk insurance to projects across a range of sectors . DFC’s
  Project Development program is designed to improve the commercial sustainability
  of a project that may receive DFC financing or insurance support. In addition, DFC's
  Project Development support enables projects to be more self sustaining and to mobilize
  other capital.  The program complements and does not duplicate work funded by other
  agencies or financiers
