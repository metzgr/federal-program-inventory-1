objective: "The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities aim to achieve the following\
  \ outcomes through a variety of pilot projects:\n•\tIncreased markets (supply and\
  \ demand) for climate-smart commodities;\n•\tIncreased adoption of Climate-Smart\
  \ Agriculture and Forestry (CSAF) practices and systems that reduce agricultural\
  \ greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and/or increase carbon sequestration from the agricultural\
  \ sector;\n•\tDemonstration of scalable and low-cost measurement/quantification,\
  \ monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) systems;\n•\tIncreased innovation\
  \ and consistency in measuring/quantifying farm-level greenhouse gas benefits;\n\
  •\tTesting and evaluation of efficient traceability through supply chains from production\
  \ of commodity to delivery to the consumer;\n•\tImproved understanding and communication\
  \ of economic and adaptation benefits, as well as ancillary environmental benefits;\n\
  •\tEquitable administration that includes small and underserved producers as well\
  \ as early adopters (i.e., producers who have already used some climate-smart approaches);\n\
  •\tUnderstanding of marketability advantages for a variety of farm types;\n•\tEmpowerment\
  \ of farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners to drive Climate-Smart Agriculture\
  \ and Forestry markets and practice adoption; and\n•\tDevelopment of additional\
  \ public-private partnerships to foster and develop Climate-Smart Agriculture and\
  \ Forestry markets."
