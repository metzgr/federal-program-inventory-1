objective: "Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA) program funds\
  \ are used to improve the delivery of and access to mental health and wellness services\
  \ for law enforcement officers and their families through the implementation of\
  \ peer support, training, family resources, suicide prevention, and other promising\
  \ practices for wellness programs. \n\nGood mental and psychological health is just\
  \ as essential as good physical health for law enforcement officers to be effective\
  \ in keeping our communities safe from crime and violence. The Law Enforcement Mental\
  \ Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA) Program supports efforts to protect the mental\
  \ health and well-being of law enforcement officers and deputies. Unfortunately,\
  \ the stress of officers’ work and the stigma often associated with seeking assistance\
  \ for emotional and mental health issues have led to negative consequences such\
  \ as divorce, alcoholism, injury, and even an increase in suicides for officers\
  \ across the country.\n\nThe LEMHWA Implementation program aims to support state,\
  \ local, tribal, or territorial law enforcement agencies seeking to implement new\
  \ or enhance existing programs that offer training and services on officer emotional\
  \ and mental health, peer mentoring, suicide prevention, stress reduction, and support\
  \ services for officers and their families.\n\nThe COPS Office encourages small,\
  \ rural, tribal, and regional coalitions of agencies to apply for LEMHWA funding\
  \ to improve their wellness efforts—for example, initiatives such as establishing\
  \ a joint or regional Peer Support program or conducting regional training. Proposed\
  \ projects may serve one agency, a consortium of agencies, or personnel from agencies\
  \ located within a county or state."
