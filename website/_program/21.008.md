objective: "This assistance opportunity provides a matching grant of up to $200,000\
  \ per grant year to qualified organizations. \nApplicants are encouraged to apply\
  \ for a grant to provide both representation to low-income taxpayers in controversies\
  \ with the Internal Revenue Services and to provide education to low-income and\
  \ ESL individuals about their taxpayer rights and responsibilities. However, a qualified\
  \ organization may also receive a grant for operating an LITC program to inform\
  \ taxpayers for whom English is a Second Language about their taxpayer rights and\
  \ responsibilities without also providing controversy representation."
