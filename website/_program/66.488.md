objective: 'The purpose of this grant program is to increase drinking water system
  resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events and reduce cybersecurity
  vulnerabilities. Grant funding can be used to assist in the planning, design, construction,
  implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or project that increases
  resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events or reduces cybersecurity
  vulnerabilities. Funding priority is for projects that increase drinking water system
  resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events or reduces cybersecurity
  vulnerabilities in public water systems that serve a community with a population
  of 10,000 or more. Eligible activities for funding include planning, design, construction,
  implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or project that increases
  resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events, or reduces cybersecurity
  vulnerabilities, through: (1) the conservation of water or the enhancement of water-use
  efficiency; (2) the modification or relocation of existing drinking water system
  infrastructure made, or that is at risk of being, significantly impaired by natural
  hazards or extreme weather events, including risks to drinking water from flooding;
  (3) the design or construction of new or modified desalination facilities to serve
  existing communities; (4) the enhancement of water supply through the use of watershed
  management and source water protection; (5) the enhancement of energy efficiency
  or the use and generation of renewable energy in the conveyance or treatment of
  drinking water;

  (6) the development and implementation of measures- (A) to increase the resilience
  of the eligible entity to natural hazards and extreme weather events; or (B) to
  reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities; (7) the conservation of water or the enhancement
  of a water supply through the implementation of water reuse measures; or (8) the
  formation of regional water partnerships to collaboratively address documented water
  shortages.'
