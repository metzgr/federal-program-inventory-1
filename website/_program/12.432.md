    The efficiency of turbine engines is influenced significantly by the internal
    flow, and recent work has demonstrated the ability of novel inlet flow geometries
    to improve engine performance. Rapidly modifying geometries for device testing
    can be streamlined by using additive manufacturing; however, additive manufacturing
    often results in rough surfaces, which in turn can affect flow dynamics. Flow
    within the interior of devices has long been measured utilizing particle image
    velocity (PIV); however, complex device geometries often make experimental setups
    for PIV prohibitively difficult. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
    has emerged as a powerful technology for characterizing 3D flow fields in complex
    geometries as well as multiphase flows.'
