objective: "The COPS Office Preparing for Active Shooter Situations (PASS) Program\
  \ is designed to meet the goal of the 2016 Protecting Our Lives by Initiating COPS\
  \ Expansion (POLICE) Act in offering “scenario-based, integrated response courses\
  \ designed to counter active shooter threats or acts of terrorism against individuals\
  \ or facilities”) 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(17). \n\nThe COPS Office seeks a provider\
  \ who can train at least 20,000 first responders nationwide over the course of the\
  \ award through scenario-based, multidisciplinary training classes. The training\
  \ should be available to any jurisdiction in the U.S. and delivered in the desired\
  \ location of the requesting agency, to include law enforcement, fire, and emergency\
  \ medical services (EMS). The target audience for the delivered training is a multidisciplinary\
  \ team of first responders, which includes law enforcement, fire, emergency medical\
  \ services (EMS), dispatchers, medical personnel, facility security, emergency management,\
  \ and any other professionals who may reasonably be key to a successful integrated\
  \ response to an active shooter event. The training provider should be able to assist\
  \ the requesting agency in determining which responders make the most sense to be\
  \ included in a multidisciplinary class. \n\nThe training provider should be able\
  \ to offer training in the following topic areas: \n• Incident command system training\
  \ for EMS, fire and law enforcement to improve coordination when responding to active\
  \ shooter incidents \n• Training for medical first responders on best practices\
  \ to treat victims of active shooter incidents.\n• Training for emergency call center\
  \ staff (dispatchers) to improve communications to fire, EMS and law enforcement\
  \ agencies during active shooter incidents. \n\nIn addition to providing integrated\
  \ multidisciplinary training, the provider should also offer courses to law enforcement\
  \ on the principles of team and solo officer movement, defense, tactics, car stops,\
  \ entry techniques, evaluation of response, and the importance of post engagement\
  \ requirements to develop better response to active shooter incidents. The training\
  \ should be conducted in a controlled environment and evaluated to inform ongoing\
  \ training. \n\nThe provider should also offer a training course for school resource\
  \ officers (SRO) and school personnel on both preparing their communities for a\
  \ hostile event and responding to an active shooter. Part of the training should\
  \ include information on a response and recovery plan and the importance of coordination\
  \ with community resources and stakeholders, student engagement and problem solving,\
  \ innovative methods to support communities in rural areas and with limited resources.\
  \ Training should include simulation exercises in schools to ensure first responders\
  \ and school staff are trained in a realistic environment. A minimum of ten percent\
  \ of training directed to audiences responsible for active shooter response in schools\
  \ and on campuses. This training will provide priority access for SROs funded through\
  \ the CHP Program. \n\nAll offered training should recognize that civilians are\
  \ part of the first response to an active shooter and when they are prepared, they\
  \ can be valuable to law enforcement in rapidly ending the threat. The training\
  \ should have clear learning objectives, opportunities for simulated, scenario-based\
  \ exercises, and participant evaluations of the course and materials for the purposes\
  \ of continuous improvement. The provider may propose the use of existing curricula,\
  \ the modification of curricula, and the development of new curricula to meet these\
  \ requirements. The provider should be able to conduct ongoing evaluation of their\
  \ training offerings, including short and long-term follow up with participating\
  \ jurisdictions on the usefulness of the training and local efforts to reinforce\
  \ knowledge and skills. The provider should demonstrate their ability to obtain\
  \ certification for their training programs via state Peace Officer Standards and\
  \ Training (POST) Commissions or national certification bodies. \n\nIn recognition\
  \ of workforce turnover and the realities of skill depreciation, the provider should\
  \ offer virtual, online, or other supplemental materials for all offered courses\
  \ to aid agencies in reinforcing knowledge and skills with their multidisciplinary\
  \ partners. \n\nFinally, the provider should demonstrate their ability to stay on\
  \ top of the latest developments, standards, and after-action reviews of active\
  \ shooter events, helping the COPS Office and its first responder partners to understand\
  \ the evolving nature of these events and apply analysis of events to continually\
  \ improving the quality of the training courses. As part of this work, the provider\
  \ should develop a plan to test tactical responses in a controlled environment and\
  \ evaluate to inform ongoing training."
