objective: "The purpose of the 2024 EMBAG cooperative agreement is to support the\
  \ use of national-level standards for emergency management to help ensure that state,\
  \ local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) communities have accredited emergency management\
  \ programs and certified emergency managers in place before an incident occurs.\
  \ To achieve this purpose, the EMBAG supports voluntary national-level standards\
  \ and peer review assessment processes that communities can use to identify the\
  \ capacity and shortfalls of their emergency management programs and emergency managers\
  \ and develop a path to compliance with these standards. These national-level standards\
  \ fall under “other assistance” called out under Section 503 (b)(2)(G) of the Homeland\
  \ Security Act of 2002 to “build tribal, local, State, regional, and national capabilities…necessary\
  \ to respond to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster.”\
  \ See 6 U.S.C. § 313(b)(2)(G). \n\nThe EMBAG directly supports the DHS Strategic\
  \ Plan Fiscal Years 2020-2024, Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience, Objective\
  \ 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness and Objective 5.2: Respond During\
  \ Incidents, by supporting efforts that can help ensure that state, tribal, territorial,\
  \ and local communities have accredited emergency management programs and certified\
  \ emergency managers in place before an incident occurs. The EMBAG program reinforces\
  \ FEMA’s mission of advancing all-hazards preparedness, consistent with the Post-Katrina\
  \ Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) and Presidential Policy Directive\
  \ 8 (PPD-8), National Preparedness. \n\nThe performance of the EMBAG is measured\
  \ against the intended outcomes identified in the Objectives section of Section\
  \ A: Program Description in the 2024 EMBAG NOFO. Applicants should refer to Appendix\
  \ B: Detail on EMBAG Performance Measurement of the 2024 EMBAG NOFO for additional\
  \ information on these metrics, including guidance and a template for reporting.\
  \ Please refer to the 2024 NOFO for additional information: \nhttps://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/356059."
