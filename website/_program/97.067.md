objective: 'The objective of the HSGP is to fund SLTT efforts to prevent terrorism
  and prepare the Nation for threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to the
  security of the United States. HSGP consists of three components: the State Homeland
  Security Program (SHSP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), and Operation Stonegarden
  (OPSG). SHSP supports state, local, tribal, and territorial preparedness activities
  in efforts to build, sustain, and deliver the capabilities necessary to prevent,
  prepare for, protect against, mitigate, and respond to acts of terrorism. UASI assists
  high-threat, high-density Urban Areas in efforts to build, sustain, and deliver
  the capabilities necessary to prevent, prepare for, protect against, mitigate, and
  respond to acts of terrorism. OPSG supports enhanced cooperation and coordination
  among Customs and Border Protection (CBP), United States Border Patrol (USBP), and
  federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies. OPSG provides
  funding to support joint efforts to secure the United States’ borders along routes
  of ingress from international borders to include travel corridors in states bordering
  Mexico and Canada as well as states and territories with international water borders.
  DHS/FEMA will award SHSP and UASI funds based on DHS/FEMA’s relative risk methodology
  pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended.'
