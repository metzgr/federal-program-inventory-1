objective: The Kapapahuliau Grant Program, authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act
  (P.L. 117-169, Title VIII Sec. 80002), provides funding to Native Hawaiian Organizations
  to leverage traditional Native Hawaiian knowledge in enhancing response and resilience
  to adverse weather events and subsequent environmental impacts. The activities funded
  by this program aim to promote the self-sufficiency, self-determination, and self-reliance
  of the Native Hawaiian Community and their lands. Projects supported by the grant
  will address various issues such as drought, wildfires, invasive species, storm-related
  flooding, tidal inundation, and erosion mitigation, while also considering the associated
  economic impacts.
