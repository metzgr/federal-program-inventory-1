objective: 'The Maritime Environmental and Technical Assistance Program (META) supports
  the research, demonstration, and development of emerging technologies, practices,
  and processes to support a safe, efficient, and competitive U.S. Maritime Transportation
  System. META partners closely with other government agencies, industry, academia,
  and NGOs to carry out its mission. Results of META-funded projects help to "de-risk"
  new technology applications and provides necessary data for industry to understand
  "what works." In addition, data from META projects support US policy decisions.

  Since its inception, projects funded through META have primarily focused on major
  environmental issues such as vessel and port emissions reduction and the control
  of aquatic invasive species transported by vessels. Over the years, those topics
  have broadened to include energy efficiency, emissions, alternative fuel and technology
  applications, hull fouling, and most recent, vessel-generated underwater noise.
  These topics present significant continuing challenges for ship owners and operators,
  the regulatory community, and the public. As other maritime environmental issues
  emerge, additional areas of study may be included.'
