objective: 'The Hazardous Waste Management uses Section 4 funding to contract directly
  with private sector vendors to provide technical support for site investigation
  and remedial actions at the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) waste sites.


  The Department of Agriculture (USDA) CCC managed a large-scale surplus grain storage
  program from the late 1930’s until the mid-1970s as part of USDA’s price support
  program for American farmers. The CCC operated the grain storage program at various
  leased properties in Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, and other states. Because much
  of the grain was stored for extended periods of time, it was periodically necessary
  to fumigate the grain to control destructive insects. The fumigant mixture most
  commonly used by CCC contained the chlorinated solvent carbon tetrachloride. Carbon
  tetrachloride was used as a pesticide for the stored grain until banned by the Environmental
  Protection Agency in 1985.'
